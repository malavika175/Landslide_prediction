# Landslide_prediction
This project is a real-time landslide prediction system that uses sensor data and a machine learning model to detect the possibility of landslides. It collects live data from various sensors such as slope, soil moisture, barometric pressure, rainfall, and ground vibration through serial communication. The collected data is preprocessed, scaled, and then passed into a trained deep learning model to predict the risk level. The prediction results are shown on a web-based dashboard, where users can monitor the real-time status. If the prediction is very high, the system will automatically trigger a siren to alert people nearby. This helps in providing early warnings and improving safety in landslide-prone areas.
